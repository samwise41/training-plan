## 3. Training Parameters

**Methodology:** 80/20 Science-Based Periodization.

* **80%:** Zone 2 - Builds mitochondrial density.
* **20%:** Zone 4/5 - Raises the performance ceiling.

### Cycling Power Zones (Based on 241W FTP)

* **Zone 1 (Recovery):** < 133W
* **Zone 2 (Endurance):** 134W – 180W
* **Zone 3 (Tempo):** 181W – 210W
* **Sweet Spot**: 211W – 226W
* **Zone 4 (Threshold):** 227W – 253W
* **Zone 5 (VO2 Max):** 254W – 289W

### Running Heart Rate Zones (Based on 171 bpm LTHR)

* **Zone 1 (Recovery):** < 139 bpm
* **Zone 2 (Endurance):** 140 – 152 bpm
* **Zone 3 (Tempo):** 153 – 161 bpm
* **Zone 4 (Threshold):** 162 – 170 bpm
* **Zone 5a (Anaerobic Capacity):** 171 – 174 bpm
* **Zone 5b (Anaerobic Endurance):** 175 – 181 bpm
* **Zone 5c (Anaerobic Power):** > 182 bpm

### Workout Design Preferences
* **Run Format:** Prescribe runs by **Time** (e.g., 45 mins at 9:15 pace or HR zone 2), not Distance.
* **Swim Format:** Prescribe swims by **Time**.
* **Bike Format:** Prescribe rides by **Time** and **Power/Zone**.
* **Interval Style:** Athlete prefers longer, sustained efforts (e.g., 2x20m Sweet Spot) over complex, multi-step ladders. Keep structure simple. Athlete likes to leverage the gamification of Zwift for indoor rides, especially for high intensity workouts. Use Zwift races when possible for high intensity workouts and use challenges like Alpe du Zwift for FTP testing.


## 4. Periodization Phases and Microcycle Templates

### **Phases**
| **Phase** | **Dates** | **Focus** | **Key Workouts** | **Exit Criteria (Milestone)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Base/Prep** | Now – Feb 28 | Aerobic Engine & Swim Form | Z2 Rides, Drill Swims | Ride 3.5h with <5% cardiac drift (HR decoupling). |
| **2. Tri-Build** | Mar 1 – May 15 | Threshold Power & Durability | Sweet Spot Intervals, Brick Runs | Hold 90% FTP for 30 mins continuous. |
| **3. Peak/Taper** | May 16 – June 20 | Race Specificity | Race Simulations, High Intensity Taper | Complete "Metric Sim" (50mi Bike + 5mi Run). |
| **4. Century Pivot** | June 21 – Aug 16 | Aerobic Volume | Long Sat Rides (4-5h), Hydration/Fueling | 80-mile Ride w/ Energy Levels Stable (No bonking). |
| **5. 70.3 Final** | Aug 17 – Sept 11 | Sustained Durability | 70.3 Pacing, Half-Marathon Runs | Race Pace Brick: 2.5h Bike + 40m Run off the bike. |

### **Standard Microcycle Templates**
These templates define the "default" week structure.
* **Weeks 1-3 (Loading):** Follow the Phase Template below.
* **Week 4 (Deload):** Reduce volume by 40%. Keep frequency but shorten sessions.

#### Phase 1: Base/Prep (Focus: Aerobic Capacity & Skill)
  * **Mon:** [BIKE] Strength / Hill Focus (60m)
  * **Tue:** [SWIM] Technique Focus (30-45m)
  * **Wed:** [RUN] Threshold / Tempo (45m)
  * **Thu:** [BIKE] Mid-Week Aerobic Volume (60-90m)
  * **Fri:** [RUN] Aerobic Maintenance (45-60m)
  * **Sat:** [BIKE] Long Steady Distance (2.5h - 4.0h)
  * **Sun:** Rest Day

#### Phase 2: Build (Focus: Threshold & Durability)
  * **Mon:** [SWIM] Endurance Intervals (45-60m)
  * **Tue:** [BIKE] Intervals (Sweet Spot or Threshold) (60-75m)
  * **Wed:** [RUN] Tempo / Hills (45-60m)
  * **Thu:** [SWIM] Recovery (45m Total)
  * **Fri:** [RUN] Aerobic Maintenance (40m)
  * **Sat:** [BRICK] Long Bike + Transition Run (3h - 5h Total)
  * **Sun:** Rest Day

### **Progression & Scaling Rules**

Use these mathematical rules to generate the specific duration and intensity for future weeks.

#### 1. The 10% Volume Rule (Sport Specific)
  * **Global Cap:** Total weekly duration (all sports combined) should not increase by more than **15%** week-over-week.
  * **Run Cap (Impact):** Total running duration must **strictly** adhere to the 10% rule. Do not increase running time by >10% week-over-week to protect the IT Band.
  * **Bike/Swim Cap (Aerobic):** Cycling and Swimming duration may increase by up to **20%** week-over-week, provided the global cap is respected. This allows for faster aerobic scaling due to lower impact forces.

#### 2. The "Long Session" Step-Ladder
  * **Logic:** The Saturday Long Bike is the primary driver of endurance.
  * **Pattern:** Increase duration by **30 minutes** every 4-week block (Mesocycle), not every week.
      * *Block 1:* 2.5h
      * *Block 2:* 3.0h
      * *Block 3:* 3.5h
  * **Cap:** Cap at 5.5 hours (Century Ride prep).
  * **Exception (Winter Strategy):** If "Winter Strategy" (Section 2) is active, CAP Saturday rides at 2.0 hours. Reallocate the missing volume to the Wednesday mid-week ride (up to 90 mins). And adding an additional easy ride on a swim day if needed.

#### 3. Deload Protocol (Week 4)
  * **Logic:** Every 4th week must shed fatigue to allow adaptation.
  * **Volume:** Reduce total weekly duration to **60%** of the previous week.
  * **Intensity:** Maintain one high-intensity session (to keep blood plasma high) but reduce the number of intervals by 50%.

#### 4. Missed Workout Logic
* **Rule of Priority:** If a "Key Workout" (Intervals or Long Ride) is missed, it takes priority over an "Aerobic Maintenance" session later in the week.
* **The "No-Stacking" Rule:** Never reschedule a high-intensity interval session to the day immediately following a Long Run or Long Ride.
* **The "Lost Cause" Rule:** If >2 days are missed in a single week, reduce the remaining week's volume by 20% to prevent "cramming" stress.

#### 5. Race Week Taper Protocol
* **Volume:** Reduce Race Week volume by **50%** compared to the previous week.
* **Frequency:** Keep the same number of sessions (do not take extra days off), but cut duration in half.
* **Intensity:** Include some short bursts of "Race Pace" intensity (e.g., 3 x 2 min) early in the week to keep the system primed, but avoid fatigue.

# Appendix D: Athlete Handover & Training Overview

## Project Overview

This document serves as a high-level handover for a transition between coaches or for initiating a new AI session. It outlines the specific training architecture we have developed, the athlete's non-negotiable requirements for documentation, and a guide on how to utilize the Master Training Plan effectively.

## 1. Summary of Document Sections

### Section 1: Athlete Profile & Baseline Metrics

* **Focus:** The "Starting Point."

* **Content:** This section contains current physiological data, injury history, and specific performance goals. It defines the "North Star" for the entire program.

* **Coaching Note:** Use this to ensure every prescribed session aligns with the athlete's long-term objectives and physical constraints.

### Section 2: The Master Training Plan (MTP)

* **Focus:** The "Roadmap."

* **Content:** A periodized calendar detailing mesocycles (phases) and microcycles (weeks). It includes specific endurance protocols, interval structures, and recovery sessions.

* **Coaching Note:** This is the primary living document. It should be updated weekly based on the athlete's subjective feedback and actual output data.

## 2. Requirements for the Master Plan

The athlete has established specific requirements for how the training must be documented and managed:

1. **Transparency:** All training intensity must be clearly defined and based on the athlete's established **cycling power zones** and **heart rate zones**. Prescriptions should refer to specific percentages of FTP (Functional Threshold Power) or Max HR to ensure objective scaling.

2. **Flexibility:** The plan must include "audible" options for days when recovery is low or external stress is high. This ensures the athlete remains consistent without overtraining.

3. **Data-Driven:** Every 4th week is a mandatory deload/testing week. During this time, data from the previous block must be analyzed to adjust the zones and targets for the following block.

## 3. How to Use the Master Plan

## Weekly Generator Checklist (SOP)
* [ ] **Review Entire Plan:** Review the entire master plan making sure to understand all rules, restrictions, schedules, training history, archived training history if necessary.
* [ ] **Review Actuals:** Did the athlete miss >2 days? (If yes, trigger "Lost Cause" Rule).
* [ ] **Check Phase:** Are we shifting phases this week? (Check Dates).
* [ ] **Apply Template:** Select the correct Microcycle Template for the current Phase. Confirm that you determined the correct week (don't try and take a shortcut here).
* [ ] **Calculate Volume:** Apply the **10% Volume Rule** to last week's *completed* duration. Verify if "Winter Strategy" (Section 2) is active. If it is follow that rule. 
* [ ] **Verify the Zones:** Ensure that the power and heart rate zones used in the upcoming week's prescriptions match the most recent testing data found in the baseline metrics.
* [ ] **Place Key Workouts:** Slot the Intervals and Long Ride first. Stick to phase template above when possible. Make sure workouts stick within the training availability section. 
* [ ] **Logic Check:** Ensure no high-intensity session follows a Long Ride ("No-Stacking Rule").
* [ ] **Event Check:** Is there a race this week? (If yes, apply "Taper Protocol").


# Appendix E: AI Prompt

I have a training plan location in this github location. Can you review this file thoroughly and help me generate my training for the next week. Please generate a raw markdown text of next week's schedule. If I forget to attach the GitHub repo, please remind me before spinning your wheels. Please provide evidence that you followed the Weekly Generator Checklist SOP.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
1. Return the schedule **ONLY** as a raw text Markdown table.
2. You **MUST** use these exact column headers: `| Status | Day | Planned Workout | Planned Duration | Actual Workout | Actual Duration | Notes / Targets | Date |`
3. Do **NOT** change the header names or order, or the dashboard parser will break.
4. Dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
5. Do not include Strength/Yoga/Stretching in this table; only Run/Bike/Swim.
6. "Status" should be "PLANNED" for all future workouts.
