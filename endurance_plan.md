  * Saturday Floor: Saturday long rides will stay at 2h until the weather allows for outdoor riding or the "Century Pivot" phase begins.
  * Total Load: This shift maintains the weekly "Time in Zone" required for Phase 1 mitochondrial adaptation.

## 3. Training Parameters

**Methodology:** 80/20 Science-Based Periodization.

* **80%:** Zone 2 - Builds mitochondrial density.
* **20%:** Zone 4/5 - Raises the performance ceiling.


**Workout Design Preferences**
* **Run Format:** Prescribe runs by **Time** (e.g., 45 mins at 9:15 pace or HR zone 2), not Distance.
* **Swim Format:** Prescribe swims by **Time**.
  * **Swim Frequency Rule:** Minimum 2 sessions per week. If time-crunched, a 15-minute "touch swim" (drills only) counts towards this frequency. 3x/week preferred in Phase 2. 
  * **Open Water Transfer:** Starting in Phase 2, every endurance swim must include 6–10 "sighting reps" (lifting head to look forward mid-stroke) and at least one 400m+ continuous segment with no wall push-offs.
* **Bike Format:** Prescribe rides by **Time** and **Power/Zone**.
* **Interval Style:** Athlete prefers longer, sustained efforts (e.g., 2x20m Sweet Spot) over complex, multi-step ladders. Keep structure simple. Athlete likes to leverage the gamification of Zwift for indoor rides, especially for high intensity workouts. Use Zwift races when possible for high intensity workouts and use challenges like Alpe du Zwift for FTP testing.

* **Sweet Spot**: 211W – 226W
* **Zone 4 (Threshold):** 227W – 253W
* **Zone 5 (VO2 Max):** 254W – 289W

### Running Heart Rate Zones (Based on 171 bpm LTHR)

* **Zone 1 (Recovery):** < 139 bpm
* **Zone 2 (Endurance):** 140 – 152 bpm
* **Zone 3 (Tempo):** 153 – 161 bpm
* **Zone 4 (Threshold):** 162 – 170 bpm

### **Standard Microcycle Templates**
These templates define the "default" week structure.
* **Weeks 1-3 (Loading):** Follow the Phase Template below.
* **Week 4 (Deload):** Reduce volume by 40%. Keep frequency but shorten sessions.

#### Phase 1: Base/Prep (Focus: Aerobic Capacity & Skill)
  * **Mon:** [BIKE] Strength / Hill Focus (60m)
    * *Target: Low Cadence (60-70rpm) to build torque.*
  * **Tue:** [SWIM] Technique Focus (30-45m)
  * **Wed:** [RUN] Tempo / Threshold (45m)
    * *Constraint: If Monday's Bike was high intensity (Sweet Spot/Threshold), keep this run Z2/Z3 steady. Max 2 hard sessions per week TOTAL.*
    * *Target: Build running economy at speed.*
  * **Thu:** [BIKE] Mid-Week Aerobic Endurance (60-90m)
  * **Fri:** [SWIM] Touch Swim (15-20m)
  * **Fri:** [RUN] Aerobic Maintenance (45-60m)
  * **Sat:** [BIKE] Long Steady Distance (2.5h - 4.0h)
    * *Target: Monitor Cardiac Drift (Efficiency Factor).*
  * **Sun:** Rest Day

#### Phase 2: Build (Focus: Threshold & Durability)
  * **Mon:** [SWIM] Endurance Intervals (45-60m)
  * **Tue:** [BIKE] Strength Intervals (Sweet Spot or Threshold) (60-75m)
    * *Target: Sustained power at lower cadence for muscular endurance.*
  * **Wed:** [RUN] Tempo / Speed Intervals (45-60m)
    * *Week A:_ Tempo / Speed Intervals.*
    * *Week B:_ Steady Z2 + 4-6 x 20sec Strides (Focus on form, not metabolic cost).*
  *  **Thu:** [SWIM] Recovery + **T1 Simulation** (45m Total)
      * *Drill:* If in open water or appropriate pool setting, practice the "Shore Exit" (run until water is knee-deep, then high-step) and "Wetsuit Strip" (peel to waist while running) immediately after the main set.
  * **Fri:** [RUN] Aerobic Maintenance (40m)
    * *Week A:_ Aerobic Maintenance (40m).*
    * *Week B:_ Long Run (60 → 90m progression). _Target: Resilience, not speed._*
  * **Sat:** [BRICK] Long Steady Distance + **T2 Practice** + Run (3h - 5h Total)
    * *Focus:* Set up a full transition area (towel, shoes, helmet) before the ride.
    * *Drill:* Practice the physical dismount, bike racking, helmet off, shoes on, and "run out" mechanics at race speed before settling into the steady run pace.
  * **Sun:** Rest Day

### **Progression & Scaling Rules**

Use these mathematical rules to generate the specific duration and intensity for future weeks.

#### 1. The Volume Increase Rules
This logic dictates the maximum allowed week-over-week volume increase. The total weekly duration for each sport should not increase by more than the following percentages:

  * **All Cap:** [15%] - Total weekly duration (all sports combined) limit week-over-week.
  * **Run Cap:** [10%] - Total running duration limit. Strict adherence due to high impact forces.
  * **Bike Cap:** [20%] - Cycling duration limit. Allows for faster aerobic scaling due to lower impact forces.
  * **Swim Cap:** [20%] - Swimming duration limit. Allows for faster aerobic scaling due to lower impact forces.

#### 2. The "Long Session" Step-Ladder
  * **Logic:** The Saturday Long Bike is the primary driver of endurance.
  * **Pattern:** Increase duration by **30 minutes** every 4-week block (Mesocycle), not every week.
      * *Block 1:* 2.5h
      * *Block 2:* 3.0h
      * *Block 3:* 3.5h
  * **Cap:** Cap at 5.5 hours (Century Ride prep).
  * **Exception (Winter Strategy):** If "Winter Strategy" (Section 2) is active, CAP Saturday rides at 2.0 hours. Reallocate the missing volume to the Wednesday mid-week ride (up to 90 mins). And adding an additional easy ride on a swim day if needed.

#### 3. Deload Protocol (Week 4)
  * **Logic:** Every 4th week must shed fatigue to allow adaptation.
  * **Volume:** Reduce total weekly duration to **60%** of the previous week.
  * **Intensity:** Maintain one high-intensity session (to keep blood plasma high) but reduce the number of intervals by 50%.
* **Skill (The "Fourth Discipline"):** Add one dedicated **Transition Mechanics Session (30 mins)**.
      * *Activity:* "Dry Run" practice in your living room or garage.
      * *Drills:* Wetsuit stripping (use baby powder/lubricant), helmet buckle speed, shoe entry (with elastic laces), and layout organization.
      * *Goal:* Build muscle memory for the order of operations: Helmet ON before Bike OFF rack.

#### 4. Missed Workout Logic
* **Rule of Priority:** If a "Key Workout" (Intervals or Long Ride) is missed, it takes priority over an "Aerobic Maintenance" session later in the week.
* **The "No-Stacking" Rule:** Never reschedule a high-intensity session to the day immediately following a Long Run or Long Ride.
* **The "Lost Cause" Rule:** If >2 days are missed in a single week, reduce the remaining week's volume by 20% to prevent "cramming" stress.

#### 5. Race Week Taper Protocol
* **Volume:** Reduce Race Week volume by **50%** compared to the previous week.
* **Frequency:** Keep the same number of sessions (do not take extra days off), but cut duration in half.
* **Intensity:** Include some short bursts of "Race Pace" intensity (e.g., 3 x 2 min) early in the week to keep the system primed, but avoid fatigue.

#### 6. Bike Strength Specificity Rule
* **Phase 1 (Base):** Focus on **Pure Force**. Intervals should be short (4-6 min) at **Low Cadence (60-65 rpm)** and upper Zone 2 power.
* **Phase 2 (Build):** Focus on **Muscular Endurance**. Intervals extend to 10-20 mins at **Sweet Spot power** with a cadence of **75-85 rpm**.
* **Phase 3 (Peak):** Focus on **Race Specificity**. Intervals match your race power targets at your **natural race cadence (90+ rpm)**. No artificial grinding.

#### 7. Century Pivot Strategy (Phase 4 Specifics)
* **Maintenance Rule:** During the Century Pivot (June 21 – Aug 16), ensure one run every 10–14 days is ≥75 minutes to maintain tissue resilience.
* **Brick Rule:** Include one short (15 min) brick run off a long ride bi-weekly to prevent form decay while focusing on bike volume.

#### 8. Brick & Transition Logic
* **The "Hard Mount" Rule:** For brick rides, the first 2 minutes of the bike leg must be capped at Zone 2, regardless of adrenaline.
* **The "5-Minute Discipline" Rule:** For brick runs, the first 5 minutes must stay ≤ Zone 2 HR (or strict pace cap), regardless of how good the legs feel. This trains restraint under fatigue.

## 8. Documentation Workflow

> **CRITICAL:** Maintain all header naming conventions exactly as written. These specific headers drive the automated dashboard logic. Do not rename or remove headers during updates.

**Source of Truth:** [endurance_plan.md](https://github.com/samwise41/training-plan/blob/main/endurance_plan.md)
**Archived Historical Training Log** [MASTER_TRAINING_DATABASE.md](https://github.com/samwise41/training-plan/blob/main/MASTER_TRAINING_DATABASE.md)

1. **Import:** pull the latest Markdown source from the GitHub repository above.
2. **Update:** Log results in Section 5 (Planned vs. Actual). Ensure section headers remain unchanged.
3. **Export:** Copy raw Markdown from the "Raw Source View" in this chat.
4. **Save:** Commit and push the updated Markdown to your GitHub repository.

## 9. Workout Naming Taxonomy

To ensure the automated dashboard correctly tracks "Performance Signatures," all planned workouts must contain specific keywords in their title or description.

### 1. Endurance (The Engine)
* **Focus:** Aerobic Efficiency & Cardiac Drift.
* **Keywords to use:** `Long`, `Steady`, `Endurance`, `Base`, `Zone 2`, `Z2`, `Recovery`.
* **Example:** `[BIKE] Long Steady Distance (Zone 2)`

### 2. Strength & Power (The Chassis)
* **Focus:** Force Production, Torque, & High Intensity.
* **Keywords to use:** `Strength`, `Hill`, `Climb`, `Torque`, `Force`, `Alpe`, `FTP`, `Race`, `Test`, `Threshold`, `Tempo`, `Sweet Spot`, `Interval`.
* **Example:** `[BIKE] Alpe du Zwift Climb` or `[BIKE] Strength Intervals` or `[BIKE] Zwift Race`.

### 3. Running Economy
* **Focus:** Speed per Heartbeat.
* **Keywords to use:** `Tempo`, `Threshold`, `Speed`, `Interval`, `Fartlek`, `Long`, `Base`, `Z2`, 'Zone2'.
* **Note:** Almost all run types are tracked for economy, but ensure `Tempo` or `Speed` is used for faster sessions.

# Appendix E: AI Prompt

I have a training plan location in this github location. Can you review this file thoroughly, **specifically cross-referencing `COACH_BRIEFING.md`, garmin_health.md and `MASTER_TRAINING_DATABASE.md`**. Please generate my training for the next week? 

Please generate a raw markdown text of next week's schedule. Please provide evidence that you followed the Weekly Generator Checklist SOP. If I forget to attach the GitHub repo, please remind me before spinning your wheels. 

**ADAPTIVE LOGIC INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **Analyze (Trends):** Read `COACH_BRIEFING.md` first. Identify any metrics flagged with "⚠️ Low" or "⚠️ High", or those showing "Improving" or "Declining" trends that may require attention. Read `garmin_health.md` first. Identify any trends in the wrong direction that may require attention.
2. **Analyze (History):** Review the "Actual Workout" column in `MASTER_TRAINING_DATABASE.md`. Check when the last workout labeled "Zwift Race" occurred. 
3.  **Progression & Scaling Rules:** Review the progression scaling rules and make sure that all rules are incorporated. If a rule is violated, please explain why you chose to violate that rule.
4.  **Inventory Check (Zwift Library):**
   - **Trigger:** Before prescribing a custom/manual bike workout description.
   - **Action:** specificially review the `.zwo` files in the `zwift_library/` folder.
   - **Matching Logic:** Parse the XML to find a workout that matches the specific duration and physiological focus (e.g., "Low Cadence" or "Sweet Spot").
   - **Priority:** If a suitable file exists, prescribe it by name (e.g., "Do [BIKE] 'Hill Grinder.zwo'"). If not, write a new custom description.
5. **Diagnose & Prescribe:** You are the coach. Alter the standard microcycle based on the following rules:
   - **The "Fun Factor" Rule:** If I have not done a "Zwift Race" in the past 2 weeks, you MUST substitute one of the high-intensity bike sessions (Threshold or Sweet Spot) with a `[BIKE] Zwift Race`.
   - **Weakness Targeting:** For every flagged metric in the Briefing, alter the drills to fix it. Do not just copy the standard template though.
      - *Example:* If **Torque Efficiency** is low, design the "Strength" ride to specifically focus on force production (choose appropriate drills like low-cadence intervals, hill repeats, or stomps based on the current training phase).
      - *Example:* If **Ground Contact Time** is high, insert specific neuromuscular drills (e.g., high cadence spins or striders) into the aerobic runs.
      - *Requirement:* Use drills that are scientifically known to address the specific weak metric.
6. **Report:** In your response, explicitly list the weaknesses/history you identified and explain *why* you chose the specific drills (or Zwift Race) to fix them.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
6. Return the schedule **ONLY** as a raw text Markdown table.
7. You **MUST** use these exact column headers: `| Status | Day | Planned Workout | Planned Duration | Actual Workout | Actual Duration | Notes / Targets | Date |`
8. Do **NOT** change the header names or order, or the dashboard parser will break.
9. Dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
10. Do not include Strength/Yoga/Stretching in this table; only Run/Bike/Swim.
11. "Status" should be "PLANNED" for all future workouts.
12. **Naming Convention:** Use the specific keywords defined in Section 9 (Taxonomy) when naming workouts (e.g., use "Strength Intervals" instead of just "Intervals") to ensure they are tracked by the dashboard.
13. **Notes Column:** In the "Notes / Targets" column, explicitly mention the specific focus or drill prescribed (e.g., "Focus: Zwift Race for mental variety and VO2 Max stimulus").
